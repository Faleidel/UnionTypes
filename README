This is a small experiment with a function f that can take a Bool or a list of bool is its argument.

The Bool or [Bool] is obtained with a class and viewPatterns for casting of a typeable inside a pattern.

The result is that you can write

    main = do
        print $ f True
        print $ f [False,True]

And everything type check.
